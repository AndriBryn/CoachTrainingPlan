generate data on a club called BasicClub and here are the headers for that csv file:
clubs;measurements;benchmark;exercises;password
the data should look like this: Name;measurement1,measurement2,measurement3...;9-m-benchmarkformeasurement1/9-f-benchmarkformeasurement1...,9-m-benchmarkformeasurement2/9-f-benchmarkformeasurement2...;9-m-exercisewithintensity1,nextexercisewithintensity1.../9-f-exercisewithintensity1,nextexercisewithintensity1/...18-m-exercisewithintensity5,nextexercisewithintensity5.../18-f-exercisewithintensity5,nextexercisewithintensity5...;psw123

where the name is BasicClub, measurement1 is the first measurement in the name column in the exercises.csv file and measurement2 is the next one in the column and so on, benchmarkformeasurement1 is the mean for that age, gender and measurement found in the exercises.csv file under "gender""age"mean column (for example benchmarkformeasurement1 in 9-m-benchmarkformeasurement1 would be 14.81265 which is found in line 1 of the exercises.csv file and the column m9mean), exercisewithintensity1 is found in the TrainingPlanCSV.csv file under the exercise column and would be Elevated ankle iso holds because that is the first exercise which has the number 1 in the intensity column (the first two ages should have intensity 1, then the next 2 ages should have intensity 2 and so on), and finally the the password should just be psw123
